# Delta

Delta is a basic chat application we built for #sock!!!! it doesnt work yet, but we like what we've done. we hope you will too! we have used react and vite for the frontend and node.js for the backend. for user authentication, we have used jsonwebtoken (jwt). the chat application has a dark mode theme with bluish highlights. the user can create an account on Delta, and access all their chats and message history. we have also used firebase for our database. we hope you enjoy going through our submission!
